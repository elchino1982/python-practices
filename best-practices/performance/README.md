### Tutorial Directory

The `tutorial/` subdirectory contains a comprehensive guide covering all performance optimization topics in detail.

## üéØ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Understanding Performance Basics

Start with time complexity analysis to understand how your algorithms scale:

```python
# Example from 01-time-complexity-analysis.py
def efficient_search(data, target):
    """O(1) lookup using set"""
    data_set = set(data)
    return target in data_set

def inefficient_search(data, target):
    """O(n) lookup using list"""
    return target in data
```

### 2. Memory Optimization Fundamentals

Learn to optimize memory usage with appropriate data structures:

```python
# Example from 02-memory-optimization.py
# Use generators for large datasets
def memory_efficient_processing(large_dataset):
    return (process_item(item) for item in large_dataset)

# Use __slots__ for classes with many instances
class OptimizedPoint:
    __slots__ = ['x', 'y']
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x, self.y = x, y
```

### 3. Profiling Your Code

Always measure before optimizing:

```python
# Example from 05-profiling-and-benchmarking.py
import cProfile

def profile_function(func):
    profiler = cProfile.Profile()
    profiler.enable()
    result = func()
    profiler.disable()
    profiler.print_stats()
    return result
```

## üîß Performance Optimization Workflow

### Step 1: Measure First
- Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
- Don't optimize based on assumptions
- Focus on the 80/20 rule: 80% of time spent in 20% of code

### Step 2: Choose the Right Data Structure
- Lists: For ordered data with frequent appends
- Sets: For unique items and fast membership testing
- Dicts: For key-value mappings and fast lookups
- Deques: For efficient operations at both ends

### Step 3: Algorithm Optimization
- Choose algorithms with better time complexity
- Use built-in functions (they're optimized in C)
- Consider caching for expensive computations

### Step 4: Memory Optimization
- Use generators for large datasets
- Implement `__slots__` for classes with many instances
- Be mindful of object lifecycle and references

### Step 5: I/O and Concurrency
- Use appropriate buffering for file operations
- Leverage async/await for I/O-bound tasks
- Use multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks

## üìä Performance Comparison Examples

### Data Structure Performance

```python
# From 03-data-structures-selection.py
import time

def compare_membership_testing():
    data_list = list(range(10000))
    data_set = set(range(10000))
    target = 9999
    
    # List: O(n) - slow for large datasets
    start = time.time()
    result = target in data_list
    list_time = time.time() - start
    
    # Set: O(1) - fast regardless of size
    start = time.time()
    result = target in data_set
    set_time = time.time() - start
    
    print(f"Set is {list_time/set_time:.1f}x faster")
```

### String Operations

```python
# From 08-string-operations.py
def efficient_string_building(words):
    return "".join(words)  # O(n)

def inefficient_string_building(words):
    result = ""
    for word in words:
        result += word  # O(n¬≤)
    return result
```

### Caching Benefits

```python
# From 06-caching-strategies.py
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def expensive_computation(n):
    # Cached results for repeated calls
    return sum(i**2 for i in range(n))
```

## üîç Common Performance Pitfalls

### 1. Premature Optimization
```python
# Don't optimize without measuring first
# Profile to find actual bottlenecks
```

### 2. Wrong Data Structure Choice

# Bad: Using list for membership testing
if item in my_list:  # O(n)

# Good: Using set for membership testing  
if item in my_set:   # O(1)
```

### 3. Inefficient String Operations
```python
# Bad: String concatenation in loop
result = ""
for item in items:
    result += str(item)  # Creates new string each time

# Good: Join operation
result = "".join(str(item) for item in items)
```

### 4. Not Using Built-ins
```python
# Bad: Manual implementation
def find_max(numbers):
    max_val = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val

# Good: Built-in function
max_val = max(numbers)  # Optimized in C
```
