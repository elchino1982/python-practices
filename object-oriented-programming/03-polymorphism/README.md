## üîë Key Concepts

### Basic Operator Overloading
```python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
    
    def __sub__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)
    
    def __mul__(self, other):  # Dot product
        return self.x * other.x + self.y * other.y
```

### String Representation
```python
class Vector:
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"
```

### Callable Objects
```python
class Polynomial:
    def __init__(self, coefficients):
        self.coefficients = coefficients
    
    def __call__(self, x):
        return sum(coef * (x ** i) for i, coef in enumerate(self.coefficients))

# Usage: p = Polynomial([1, 2, 3])  # 1 + 2x + 3x¬≤
# result = p(2)  # Evaluate at x=2
```

### Matrix Operations
```python
class Matrix:
    def __add__(self, other):
        result = []
        for row1, row2 in zip(self.data, other.data):
            result.append([x + y for x, y in zip(row1, row2)])
        return Matrix(result)
    
    def __mul__(self, other):  # Matrix multiplication
        result = []
        for row in self.data:
            new_row = []
            for col in zip(*other.data):  # Transpose columns
                new_row.append(sum(x * y for x, y in zip(row, col)))
            result.append(new_row)
        return Matrix(result)
```

## üßÆ Magic Methods Reference

### Arithmetic Operations
- `__add__(self, other)` - Addition (`+`)
- `__sub__(self, other)` - Subtraction (`-`)
- `__mul__(self, other)` - Multiplication (`*`)
- `__truediv__(self, other)` - Division (`/`)
- `__pow__(self, other)` - Exponentiation (`**`)

### Comparison Operations
- `__eq__(self, other)` - Equal (`==`)
- `__lt__(self, other)` - Less than (`<`)
- `__gt__(self, other)` - Greater than (`>`)

### String Representation
- `__str__(self)` - Human-readable string
- `__repr__(self)` - Developer-friendly representation

### Special Methods
- `__call__(self, *args)` - Make object callable like a function
- `__len__(self)` - Length (`len()`)
- `__getitem__(self, key)` - Indexing (`obj[key]`)

## üí° Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do This
- **Return new objects** from arithmetic operations (immutability)
- **Implement `__str__` and `__repr__`** for debugging and display
- **Use meaningful variable names** in mathematical operations
- **Validate inputs** in advanced implementations
- **Follow mathematical conventions** (e.g., dot product returns scalar)

### ‚ùå Avoid This
- **Don't modify self** in arithmetic operations - return new objects
- **Don't implement operations that don't make sense** mathematically
- **Don't forget error handling** for incompatible operations
- **Don't mix up `__mul__` meanings** (scalar vs. dot product vs. matrix multiplication)

## üîç Common Patterns

### Immutable Mathematical Objects
```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self._x = x
        self._y = y
    
    def __add__(self, other):
        return Point(self._x + other._x, self._y + other._y)  # New object
```

### Validation in Operations
```python
class Vector:
    def __add__(self, other):
        if len(self.components) != len(other.components):
            raise ValueError("Vectors must have same length")
        return Vector([a + b for a, b in zip(self.components, other.components)])
```

### Fluent Interface
```python
class Calculator:
    def __init__(self, value=0):
        self.value = value
    
    def add(self, x):
        return Calculator(self.value + x)
    
    def multiply(self, x):
        return Calculator(self.value * x)

# Usage: result = Calculator(5).add(3).multiply(2)  # Chaining
```
