- Concepts: the core idea in simple terms.
- Examples: small, focused code samples.
- Patterns: common ways to solve the problem.
- Pitfalls: frequent mistakes to avoid.
- Best practices: recommended approaches.

You can approach the material in a few common ways:
- Read end-to-end to build a solid mental model.
- Jump to a topic relevant to a project you’re working on.
- Use the practice tracks to apply what you learn through hands-on exercises.
- Refer to the tooling and CI sections to improve your workflow.

Getting started
To get the most out of this guide, set up a local Python environment and a lightweight project to test ideas. The following steps help you establish a clean starting point.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer. If you work with older codebases, plan to upgrade gradually.
- A code editor you like. Popular choices include VS Code, PyCharm, and Sublime Text.
- Git for version control and collaboration.
- pip for installing packages.
- A basic terminal or command prompt for running commands.

Local setup
1) Create a new directory for your practice project.
2) Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
3) Install a minimal set of tooling for quality and testing.
4) Create a small sample module to experiment with patterns.

Example: creating a clean Python project
- Directory: practice_project
- Virtual environment: python -m venv .venv
- Activate: source .venv/bin/activate (Unix) or .venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
- Install basic tools: pip install black isort mypy pytest
- Create a module: practice.py
- Add a simple function with type hints and a docstring
- Run a quick linter and formatter: black ., isort --check ., mypy --strict practice.py
- Run tests: pytest

A note on tooling
The guide recommends consistent tooling to reduce friction. Use a code formatter to keep style consistent. Use a linter to catch potential issues early. Use a type checker to catch type errors before they become runtime bugs. Use tests to verify behavior. A simple, reliable setup makes it easier to learn and grow.

Core principles
- Simplicity matters. Simple code is easier to read and maintain.
- Clarity beats cleverness. Favor explicit approaches over clever tricks.
- Small, well-scoped functions reduce complexity.
- Documentation and naming carry weight. Names should reflect intent.
- Tests are a first-class citizen. They protect you from regressions.
- Security is a design choice, not an afterthought.
- Performance should be measured, not assumed.
- Reusability matters. Favor modular, loosely coupled components.
- Learn continuously. Stay curious and review your own work.

Clean code and readability
Readable code is code that another developer can understand quickly. It reduces cognitive load and speeds up maintenance. The key ideas are meaningful names, small functions, minimal side effects, and explicit behavior.

Naming
- Use descriptive names that reveal intent.
- Avoid abbreviations unless they’re standard.
- Name functions with verbs and classes with nouns.

Example: clear function name
def calculate_running_total(prices: list[float]) -> float:
    total = 0.0
    for price in prices:
        total += price
    return total

This function name clearly describes its purpose. The code is straightforward and easy to reason about.

Function length
- Small functions are easier to test and reuse.
- If a function grows beyond 20-30 lines, consider splitting.
- Each function should have a single responsibility.

Docstrings and comments
- Use docstrings to describe what a function does, its inputs, and its outputs.
- Keep comments concise and necessary. Avoid restating code.
- Prefer self-documenting code over verbose comments.

Example: docstring
def fetch_user_profile(user_id: int) -> dict[str, object]:
    """
    Retrieve user profile data from the database.

    Parameters:
        user_id: Unique identifier for the user.

    Returns:
        A dictionary with user profile fields.
    """
    # Implementation goes here
    return {}

Type hints
- Add type hints to improve readability and catch errors early.
- Use built-in types and typing modules for complex structures.
- Enable a type checker like mypy as part of your workflow.

Example: type hints
from typing import Dict, Any

def merge_settings(defaults: Dict[str, Any], overrides: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    result = defaults.copy()
    result.update(overrides)
    return result

Error handling
- Use explicit exceptions and avoid catching too broad errors.
- Do not suppress errors without a clear reason.
- Fail fast when a condition clearly signals a broken state.

Example: explicit error
def get_config_value(cfg: dict[str, object], key: str) -> str:
    if key not in cfg:
        raise KeyError(f"Missing configuration for '{key}'")
    value = cfg[key]
    if not isinstance(value, str):
        raise TypeError("Configuration value must be a string")
    return value

Type safety and testing
- Write tests that cover common cases and edge cases.
- Use parameterized tests to exercise multiple inputs.
- Keep tests fast and deterministic.

Example: simple test
def test_merge_settings():
    defaults = {"host": "localhost", "port": 8080}
    overrides = {"port": 9090}
    result = merge_settings(defaults, overrides)
    assert result["host"] == "localhost"
    assert result["port"] == 9090

Type-driven approach
- Think about how data flows through your code.
- Design public interfaces with clear inputs and outputs.
- Limit the use of global state to reduce surprises.

Object-oriented programming in Python
OOP helps model real-world concepts and encourages code reuse. In Python, you can design classes with clear responsibilities, use composition over inheritance where it fits, and apply encapsulation.

Classes and responsibilities
- Define classes that represent real-world concepts in your domain.
- Keep classes small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use composition to assemble complex behavior from simpler parts.

Example: simple class with responsibility
class FileProcessor:
    def __init__(self, file_path: str) -> None:
        self.file_path = file_path

    def read_lines(self) -> list[str]:
        with open(self.file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            return f.readlines()

    def count_lines(self) -> int:
        return len(self.read_lines())

Inheritance and mixins
- Use inheritance to share behavior when it makes sense.
- Consider mixins to add capabilities without creating deep hierarchies.

Example: mixin for logging
class LoggerMixin:
    def log(self, message: str) -> None:
        print(f"[LOG] {message}")

class FileProcessor(LoggerMixin):
    def __init__(self, file_path: str) -> None:
        self.file_path = file_path

    def read_lines(self) -> list[str]:
        self.log(f"Reading lines from {self.file_path}")
        with open(self.file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            return f.readlines()

Interfaces and protocols
- Use typing.Protocol to define interfaces without forcing a concrete class.
- Protocols help you write flexible, testable code.

Example: protocol
from typing import Protocol, Iterable

class Reader(Protocol):
    def read(self) -> Iterable[str]: ...

def process(reader: Reader) -> int:
    count = sum(1 for _ in reader.read())
    return count

Design patterns with Python
Design patterns provide proven solutions to common problems. They help you communicate intent and structure code in familiar ways.

Factory pattern
- Create objects without exposing the creation logic.
- Use factories to manage complex initialization.

Example: factory
class Connection:
    def __init__(self, host: str, port: int) -> None:
        self.host = host
        self.port = port

class ConnectionFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create(config: dict[str, object]) -> Connection:
        host = config.get("host", "localhost")
        port = int(config.get("port", 8000))
        return Connection(host, port)

Singleton pattern
- Use sparingly. Global state can cause hidden dependencies.
- Prefer module-level singletons or dependency injection.

Example: simple singleton via module
# In config.py
class Config:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls) -> "Config":
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
            cls._instance.settings = {}
        return cls._instance

SOLID principles in practice
Single Responsibility
- Each class or function should have one reason to change.
- Avoid large, monolithic components.

Open-Closed
- Design to be open for extension, closed for modification.
- Use abstraction to add new behavior without changing existing code.

Liskov Substitution
- Subtypes must replace their base types without altering behavior.
- Keep interfaces consistent across hierarchies.

Interface Segregation
- Narrow, client-specific interfaces work better than large, general ones.
- Break large interfaces into smaller, focused ones.

Dependency Inversion
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
- Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

Security and secure coding
Security is a design constraint, not an afterthought. Build with secure defaults, validate input, and assume hostile environments. The guide emphasizes practical steps you can implement in real projects.

Input validation
- Validate inputs at boundaries.
- Sanitize data to prevent injection attacks.
- Use well-tested libraries for parsing and validation when possible.

Example: input validation
def parse_user_input(data: dict[str, str]) -> dict[str, str]:
    if "username" not in data or not data["username"]:
        raise ValueError("Username is required")
    if "email" in data and "@" not in data["email"]:
        raise ValueError("Invalid email")
    return {"username": data["username"].strip(), "email": data.get("email", "").strip()}

Secure defaults
- Use safe defaults whenever possible.
- Avoid enabling dangerous features by default.
- Keep sensitive data out of logs and error messages.

Access control
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks.
- Use well-vetted libraries for token handling and session management.

Example: simple authorization check
def can_access(user_role: str, resource: str) -> bool:
    permissions = {"admin": {"read", "write", "delete"}, "user": {"read", "write"}}
    return resource in permissions.get(user_role, set())

Performance and optimization
Performance matters, but only after you have measurable data. Start with profiling to locate bottlenecks. Apply targeted improvements to algorithms and data structures before micro-optimizations.

Profiling and measurement
- Use profiling tools to identify hot spots.
- Profile with realistic data and workloads.
- Measure before and after changes to verify impact.

Common performance patterns
- Use efficient data structures for the task.
- Avoid unnecessary work; short-circuit when possible.
- Cache expensive results when appropriate.
- Leverage built-in libraries that are implemented in C for speed.

Example: simple memoization
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def compute_heavy(n: int) -> int:
    # Simulate a heavy computation
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += (i * i) % 97
    return total

Memory considerations
- Be mindful of memory usage in large datasets.
- Use generators and streaming when possible.
- Free resources when no longer needed.

Example: streaming data
def stream_lines(file_path: str) -> iter[str]:
    with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        for line in f:
            yield line.rstrip("\n")

Testing, debugging, and reliability
Tests verify behavior and protect against regressions. They also serve as living documentation. A reliable test suite speeds up development and helps maintain quality.

Testing types
- Unit tests verify individual components.
- Integration tests verify interactions between components.
- End-to-end tests validate user-facing flows.

Test structure
- Each test file should focus on one module.
- Name tests clearly to reflect intent.
- Use fixtures to prepare shared setup.

Example: a unit test
def test_parse_user_input_valid():
    data = {"username": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}
    result = parse_user_input(data)
    assert result["username"] == "Alice"
    assert result["email"] == "alice@example.com"

Debugging
- Use assertions and logging to diagnose issues.
- Prefer structured logging for easier filtering.
- Reproduce bugs with minimal, reproducible steps.

Continuous integration
- Run tests automatically on every change.
- Check code quality, security checks, and style on CI.
- Use matrix builds to test across versions.

Tooling, linting, and CI
Linting catches errors early and enforces style. A robust CI pipeline ensures code remains healthy as the project grows.

Linting and style
- Use a formatter to enforce consistent style.
- Use a linter to catch potential issues.
- Run checks locally before pushing changes.

Recommended tools
- Black for formatting
- isort for import sorting
- Flake8 or Pylint for linting
- Mypy for type checking
- Pytest for testing

Example: a minimal workflow
name: Python Practices CI
on:
  push:
  pull_request:
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install black isort mypy pytest
      - name: Run checks
        run: |
          black --check .
          isort --check .
          mypy .
          pytest

Examples and recipes
In this section you will find hands-on examples that demonstrate concepts clearly.

Example: safe file handling
import os
from pathlib import Path

def read_text_file(path: str) -> str:
    p = Path(path)
    if not p.exists():
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"No such file: {path}")
    with p.open("r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        return f.read()

This example shows simple, safe file access and error handling. It demonstrates how to validate conditions and provide meaningful errors.

Example: data processing pipeline
def process_records(records: list[dict[str, object]]) -> list[dict[str, object]]:
    processed = []
    for r in records:
        if "id" not in r:
            continue
        r["validated"] = True
        processed.append(r)
    return processed

- This demonstrates filtering, enrichment, and keeping a clear contract for output.
