# Abstraction in Python - Practice Exercises

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive practice exercises for learning **Abstraction** in Python - one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming. Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details while exposing only the essential features and functionality to users.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, you will master:
- **Abstract Base Classes (ABC)** and the `abc` module
- **Interface design patterns** and protocols
- **Template Method pattern** implementation
- **Metaclasses** for advanced abstraction
- **Context managers** and resource management
- **Design patterns** (Factory, Builder, Adapter, Facade)
- **Real-world abstraction** applications

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python classes and inheritance
- Familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts
- Python 3.6+ installed

### How to Use These Exercises

1. **Start with the Learning Challenge**: Each file begins with a challenge section. Try to solve it yourself first!

2. **Follow the Step-by-Step Solutions**: Each exercise includes detailed, cumulative steps that build upon each other.

3. **Run and Experiment**: Execute the code, modify it, and see how changes affect the behavior.

4. **Read the Explanations**: Each step includes detailed explanations of concepts and design decisions.

### Example Usage

```python
# Run any exercise file directly
python 01-basic-abstract-classes.py

# Or import and use the classes
from abstraction.facade_pattern import SmartHomeFacade

home = SmartHomeFacade()
home.leave_home()  # Executes complex routine with simple interface
```

## üîë Key Concepts Covered

### Abstract Base Classes (ABC)
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass
```

### Interface Design
```python
class Drawable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def draw(self):
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_bounds(self):
        pass
```

### Template Method Pattern
```python
class DataProcessor(ABC):
    def process(self, data):
        raw_data = self.load_data(data)
        processed = self.transform_data(raw_data)
        self.save_data(processed)
    
    @abstractmethod
    def transform_data(self, data):
        pass
```

### Design Patterns
- **Factory Pattern**: Create objects without specifying exact classes
- **Builder Pattern**: Construct complex objects step by step
- **Adapter Pattern**: Make incompatible interfaces work together
- **Facade Pattern**: Provide simplified interface to complex subsystems
